At 49, in the primate world, if you are still alive, you are most certainly, living out your golden years.\r\n\r\nOne such gorilla at the Brookfield Zoo is doing just that.\r\n\r\nRamar is an aging Silverback gorilla and is slowing down every day because his knees are failing.\r\n\r\nAt 375 pounds and decades of wear and tear veterinarians compare his physical state to an NFL player in their 80s.\r\n\r\nSo doctors declared surgery is a must to clean out and even improve the aging knees of this incredible animal.\r\n\r\nDr. Michael Adkesson at the Brookfield Zoo invited Dr. Mukund Komanduri, an MD and orthopedic surgeon, to help him get Ramar back on his feet and moving more comfortably again.\r\n\r\n\"Itâ€™s interesting.
