A man asked why an old lady was all alone on a cruise ship. He noticed that although she was alone, all the staff, ships officers, Waiters and busboys were very familiar with her. So, he asked the waiter who the lady was, expecting to be told…she owned the line, but all the Waiter knew was that she was on the last four cruises, back to back.

As he left the dining room one evening he caught her eye and stopped to say hello. They chatted and he asked, "I understand you've been on this ship for the last four cruises."

She replied, "Yes, that's true."

He said, "I don't understand" and she replied, without a pause, "It's cheaper than a nursing home. So, there will be no nursing home in my future. I'm staying on this cruise; the average cost for a nursing home is $200 per day. Here, I can get a long term discount and senior discount price of $135 per day. That leaves $65 a day for tips and extra cash. I have it made here.

I can have as many as 10 meals a day of fantastic food or room service which means I can have breakfast in bed every day of the week. I get free pools, a workout room, free washers and dryers and shows every night. I get free toothpaste, razors, and free soap and shampoo. They will even treat you like a customer, not a patient. An extra $5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you.

I get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days! TV broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have the matters replaced? No problem! They will fix everything and apologize for your inconvenience. Clean sheets and towels every day and you don't even have to ask for them. There is always a doctor on board. This is how I want to live the end  

 of my life. “
